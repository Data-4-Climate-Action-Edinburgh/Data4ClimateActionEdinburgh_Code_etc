# README - Documentation
This dataset contains the survey results gathered by Data4ClimateActionEdinburgh at the 2022 Edinburgh Climate Festival. At our stall, members of the public were invited to vote on which activities they would like our group to carrying out. Categories were added during the course of the event as they were suggested by participants. Participants were allowed to vote for more than one category.
